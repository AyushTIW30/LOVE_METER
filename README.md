Love Calculator
Welcome to the Love Calculator! This fun Python program calculates the "compatibility score" between you and your partner based on the letters in your names. It combines the letters from "TRUE" and "LOVE" and calculates how many times each letter appears in both names to give you a compatibility score.

Features
Takes input for two names (yours and your partner's).
Calculates a score based on the occurrence of letters in the words "TRUE" and "LOVE".
Displays a compatibility message based on the score.
How It Works
The program will ask for your name.
Then it will ask for your partner's name.
It will combine both names, count the occurrences of the letters in "TRUE" and "LOVE", and calculate the score.
Based on the score, it will print out a compatibility message.
